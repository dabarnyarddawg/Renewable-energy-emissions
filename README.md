# Renewable Energy-Associated Emissions
<br>
This project includes the data and code to support a research paper on the emissions associated with variable wind and solar energy. The paper was written for a masters-level econometrics course.

<i>Abstract:<br>
Renewable energy has great potential to reduce pollutant emissions associated with the electricity generation sector, however solar and wind produce power based on the whims of the weather. Thus, their output fluctuates over time. Until large-scale energy storage that can shift excess supply to meet demand has increased across the country, flexible fossil fuel power plants must quickly power up and down to compensate for these variations in supply. In this paper, I create a regression model using solar and wind power generation data as well as fossil fuel plant emissions data from several mid-Atlantic and Midwest states to investigate the relationship between oscillations in intermittent renewable energy generation and power plant emissions. I find that there is a small inverse relationship, suggesting that sudden drops in wind and solar output may cause additional pollutant discharges.</i>

Note: The raw datasets are not included in this repository due to size, however they can all be located in the paper citiations. The cleaned dataset is included and can be loaded directly with the analysis.R file. The data_prep.R file generates the cleaned dataset from the raw data files.
