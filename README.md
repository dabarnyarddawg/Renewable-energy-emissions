<i>Abstract:<br>
Renewable energy has great potential to reduce pollutant emissions associated with the electricity generation sector, however solar and wind produce power based on the whims of the weather. Thus, their output fluctuates over time. Until large-scale energy storage that can shift excess supply to meet demand has increased across the country, flexible fossil fuel power plants must quickly power up and down to compensate for these variations in supply. In this paper, I create a regression model using solar and wind power generation data as well as fossil fuel plant emissions data from several mid-Atlantic and Midwest states to investigate the relationship between oscillations in intermittent renewable energy generation and power plant emissions. I find that there is a small inverse relationship, suggesting that sudden drops in wind and solar output may cause additional pollutant discharges.</i>
